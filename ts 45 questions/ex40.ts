/*Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object
 describing a music album. The function should take in an artist
  name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing
these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three
 dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return
value to show that Objects are storing the album information 
correctly. Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows
 you to store the number of tracks on an album. If the calling
 line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value
 to the album’s Object. Make at least one new function callthat includes
 the number of tracks on an album. */

    let albumInfo: Record<string, unknown> = {

    if (tracks !== undefined) {

// Example usage:
const album1 = make_album("Coldplay", "A Rush of Blood to the Head");
const album2 = make_album("The Beatles", "Abbey Road", );
const album3 = make_album("Taylor Swift", "Fearless (Taylor's Version)", );
